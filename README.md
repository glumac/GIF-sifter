### About Gif Sifter

This meme search web app was created with `create-react-app` and customized from there. It uses React, Redux with Thunk middleware (https://github.com/gaearon/redux-thunk) for state management, and Styled Components (https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components). Routing is handled through React Router (https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router).

To run the app locally, simply enter `npm run start`.

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
